# Titanic_Survivor_Analysis :ship: :chart_with_upwards_trend:
  Ananlysis of Titanic Survivors

## Welcome! :wave:
Thanks for checking out this data analysis project on Titanic survivors.

**To do this challenge, we need a basic understanding of Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.** 

## The Challenge :muscle:
My challenge was to analyze the Titanic dataset and find out what factors influenced the rate of survival during the Titanic incident.

## The Conclusion : :pencil:
I was able to draw the following conclusions. 

The rate of survival depends on:
1. Gender :
   The data revealed that a higher proportion of female passengers survived compared to male passengers.
   This disparity can be attributed to the "women and children first" policy followed during the evacuation of the ship.
2. Family Size :
   the dependency on family size in the Titanic incident indicated that the size of a passenger's family group influenced their survival rate. While being part of a larger family had both positive and negative aspects.
   Solo travelers and those with smaller families might have experienced different survival dynamics.
3. Fare Paid :
   The findings revealed that fare paid was indeed associated with the chances of survival.
   Passengers who paid higher fares had a higher survival rate compared to those who paid lower fares.
4. Class :
   The dependency on class in the Titanic incident indicates that passengers in First Class had a higher likelihood of survival
   compared to those in Second and Third Class.
5. Embark Town :
   The findings indicated that the embarkation town had some correlation with the chances of survival:
   
   -Southampton: Passengers who boarded from Southampton had a mix of survival rates.
    
   -Cherbourg: Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg had a higher survival rate compared to those from Southampton and Queenstown.
   
   -Queenstown: Passengers who boarded from Queenstown had the lowest survival rate. 

## Additional Data :clipboard:
To enhance the analysis, I gathered some additional data points: 

6. Age 
7. Deck
8. Lifeboat 
9. Cabin 
10. Port of Rescue 

## Data Visualization :bar_chart: 
Let's use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create compelling visuals that bring out the patterns in the data.

## Statistical Analysis  :chart_with_upwards_trend:
I performed various statistical tests to assess the significance of the relationships found. For example, I used the Chi-square test to analyze the dependence between gender and survival.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing :broom:
Before conducting the analysis, I ensured proper data cleaning and preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization. 


## Data Storytelling :book: 
I framed my conclusions in the form of a data story, explaining the context of the Titanic incident and how each factor contributed to survival rates.

## Documentation :memo:
I made sure to document the Jupyter Notebook with clear explanations of the steps taken, my thought process, and any challenges faced during the analysis. 

Remember, data analysis is an iterative process, and there's always room for improvement and further exploration.

Happy data analyzing! If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. :smiley:
